# CiviCRM User Guide

## Scope of this guide

This guide is for [CiviCRM](https://civicrm.org) users and covers all the functionality available through CiviCRM's web-based interface.

### User Guide vs System Administrator Guide

We also have a [System Administrator Guide](https://docs.civicrm.org/sysadmin/en/latest) which covers installation, upgrades, and some of the more complicated setup tasks.

The two guides have some overlapping scope when it comes to setup and configuration. In general, we try to cover actions in the User Guide which the user can perform from within CiviCRM's user interface. Actions that require work outside of the CiviCRM interface (e.g. file-system or shell access) are covered in the System Administrator Guide.
